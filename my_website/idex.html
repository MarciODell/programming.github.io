                        The Quotation: "Character is what you are in the dark." -Dwight Lyman. The meaning of this quotation is that everyone has two sides to your personality and the true personality is only revealed when a character is left alone behind closed doors, this statement is true because a character's true personality is only ever revealed when they are alone. For example, Dazai Osamu's Book

人間失格 (Romaji: Ningen Shikkaku) or better known in English as "No Longer Human", It was first translated by Donald Keene as "No Longer Human" by the publishing company New Directions in Norfolk, Connecticut. This book follows the life of the protagonist Yozo Ōba as he does not feel human.

                    </p>




                    <p>Throughout the book Yozo shows how he is not the person everyone assumes that he is. On the outside he was a good looking and charming young man however on the inside he was an unfeeling shell of a human being. Even going as far as to panic when someone starts to notice cracks in his facade. lines like "But I had learned to play my part. I had moreover been quite a success. It was inconceivable that so talented an actor would fail away from home"42-43. or "Fairly confident that I had succeeded by now in concealing completely my true identity"43. showing Yozo was actively concealing his identity. </p>

                    <p>More evidence to Yozo hiding his true persona is this line right here "I myself spent the whole day long deceiving human beings with my clowning."37. he knew that he was deceiving people, but did Yozo truly understand what he was doing? that is something only the author himself Osamu Dazai can answer as he. himself was self-projecting onto the character he wrote within this book. a fictional autobiography most would describe this book. Osamu Dazai himself actually did give an answer to whether Yozo knew he was broken or not and it's this line right here "I was a lunatic. but no, I was definitely not mad. I have never been mad for even an instant. They say, I know, that most lunatics claim the same thing." He knew he was different. it was stated multiple times in the book that Yozo and even Osamu himself knew that they were mad and very different to those around themselves.</p>

                    <h1 style = "background:rgb(255, 255, 255)">However I must express that the claims that he was self projecting is allegeded as I cannot deny or confirm the fact osamu was self-projecting that it may seem as if it were fact and that may not be the case. However the way I wrote this essay said everything with such confidence that he was self-projecting. </h1>

                    <h1 style = "background:rgb(91, 207, 149)">So please do take what is said with a grain of salt and take it more as a theory than fact. </h1>

                    <p>The lines "Just when I had begun to relax my guard a bit fairly confident that I had succeeded by now in concealing completely my true identity, I was stabbed in the back"43. and "Not surprisingly, I failed to recognize the need to be on my guard against him." show that the boy Takeichi had caught Yozo Ōba's true persona when he thought nobody was watching him, Takeichi had noticed how all of Yozo Ōba's little stunts were not done by accident like most thought but were on purpose. This was one of the first people other than himself to ever see through the facade, His facade of pretending to be a normal functioning human being. </p>

                        In conclusion, A person's true character does come out when they think nobody is paying attention or aren't there. Yozo Ōba is a character that proves this. having only ever actually showing his true self when he believed nobody was watching or when he was alone. In the story "No Longer Human", Yozo Ōba shows that he needs to hide his true personality away from the world all because he is incapable of showing his true self as to not anger the "humans" so that they won't take him seriously and he can avoid consequences of his own actions.
